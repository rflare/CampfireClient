                I made an open source app with no rules, and I don't know what to do with it.
                Why am I writing this?
                Also code is on github
                You should contribute to the project. It needs work.
                Also somebody should manage the budgets for this project.
                Just kidding! It's a goofy side project I'm doing for fun.
                But still it would be cool.
                Did you actually read all this yapping bruhðŸ’€
